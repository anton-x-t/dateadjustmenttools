Install the plugin "Date adjustment tools"

Prerequisites: in order to install this plugin, adminstrative priviligies are needed.

1. Unzip dateadjustmenttools.zip to the folder "wwwroot/moodle/local/" (wwwroot is your LAMP/XAMPP/WAMP main server folder, e.g. C:\Moodle\server\moodle\local\).

2. Go to "localhost/admin/index.php" in your browser. Click for available updates if Moodle doesn't recognize the plugin.

3. If the plugin was added correctly the server should now prompt for installation, click "Upgrade Moodle database now".

4. After some time the page should load and say "Success". Click "Continue" on that page.

5. Go to a course home page on your Moodle site.

6. Look under "Course administration", there should now probably exist a node after "Question bank" named "Date adjustment tools".
